# Web Dev 5 · Learn the Web

Graphic designers are hired for their personality and their work 
quality. The first interaction potential employers have is through the 
designer’s online presence—most importantly a portfolio website. Leasing
 personal domains, configuring servers for email addresses, and peer 
reviews are some of the topics explored to launch a successful personal 
portfolio website.

## Learn the Web

**Learning code doesn’t have to be confounding.**

There are too many topics and too many tutorials online. It’s hard to figure 
you which are up-to-date and even harder to figure out what order to 
follow them.

Learn the Web, is a structured, curated, living guide to web development for graphic 
designers—presenting the information in a logical, targeted order that 
goes from a basic mobile-friendly webpage to a complex multi-screen 
interactive website.

## Thomas J Bradley

I believe that everybody should perpetually learn, try, build, break, 
& fix things—the Open Web is the perfect platform for exactly that.
